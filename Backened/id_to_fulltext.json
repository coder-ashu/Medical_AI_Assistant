However, there may be great variations\n\nin patient presentation, their family history, treatment preferences and tolerance for different side effect.

In other words, rational use means \u2018prescribing right medicines, in adequate dose for the sufficient duration and appropriate to the clinical needs of the patient at lowest cost\u2019. Medicine use is a complex cyclical process and in the clinical context, rational drug use implies correct drug, appropriate indication and selection with respect to efficacy, safety, suitability for the patient and cost.

Following the concept of EM, WHO published the first Essential Medicine List (EML) in 1977, which has been updated successively every 5 year in view of changing world scenario about the medical needs and availability of new and better drugs. The selection of these medicines is based on public health relevance, evidence of efficacy and safety and comparative cost-effectiveness. These priority medicines should be available at each functioning health care facility with assured quality and adequate information at a price the individual and the community can afford. The selection of essential medicines depends upon level of health care facility, adequate data on the efficacy, safety, suitability and comparative cost effectiveness of available treatments.

Most essential medicines are formulated as single compound. However, fixed dose combinations are selected only when it has proven pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic advantages over single compound administered separately. While comparing the cost of medicines among the alternative treatments, the cost of total treatment and not the unit cost is considered. Other factors taken into account include pattern of diseases, treatment facilities, training and experience of the available personnel, financial resources etc.",

Moreover, prescribing improves due to focused training and drug information, better recognition of adverse drug reactions, drug interactions and focused education efforts. The list of EM closely relates to treatment guidelines for clinical diseases and is also used for the procurement and supply of medicines in public sector, schemes for reimburses medicines costs and local medicine production.
