Essential Medicines List (EML) and the Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG) are an important component of promoting rational use of medicines. Gujarat Medical Service Corporation Limited under the auspices of Department of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Gujarat finalizes EML and has undertaken the task to develop STG for the State. The objective is to improve the availability of quality drugs at each health facility and to achieve maximum public health improvement using available resources. B. J. Medical College & Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad has been instrumental in the preparation of the STG. An attempt has been made in this manual to provide guidelines for the treatment of common diseases, keeping in mind the rational use of medicines. It is a blend of evidence from standard text and reference books with consensus of specialists. The guidelines are comprehensive, concise and seek to summarize treatment plan for patients with priority diseases. It is assumed that the patient has been fully evaluated and all co-morbidities identified. Under each clinical condition, the treatment plan has been suggested that can be applied to average patient with common presentation. However, there may be great variations in patient presentation, their family history, treatment preferences and tolerance for different side effect. Therefore, these guidelines can be viewed as an expert consultation and weighed with respect to other information. Moreover, the recommendations do not replace clinical judgment nor encroach on clinical flexibility, which must be tailored to the particular needs of each clinical situation. A large number of experienced clinicians have contributed in the preparation of these guidelines. The manual begins with a brief introduction to the concept of Rational Use of Medicines along with its important components. This is followed by chapters on common diseases and emergency conditions which may be general to all specialties. Remaining chapters describe frequent clinical conditions in each specialty, for example ENT, Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology etc. The format of the guidelines includes important salient features, diagnostic tests followed by non-pharmacological, pharmacological treatment plan and patient education, if applicable. Medicines are mentioned in generic names and choice is based on the balanced criteria of efficacy, safety, suitability and cost. This manual will be useful as ready reference for the health care providers and supply management staff. We hope this manual will help in pursuance of the objectives of Rational Use of Medicines and make the treatment more specific and effective. We thank all the experts for sharing their valuable time and expertise in developing the book.

In other words, rational use means \u2018prescribing right medicines, in adequate dose for the sufficient duration and appropriate to the clinical needs of the patient at lowest cost\u2019. Medicine use is a complex cyclical process and in the clinical context, rational drug use implies correct drug, appropriate indication and selection with respect to efficacy, safety, suitability for the patient and cost. The concept of Rational Use of Medicines is age old; however, it has attained more significance and momentum in terms of medical and socioeconomic aspects recently. Three tools have been identified to implement Rational Use of Medicines effectively. These include Essential Medicines List, Standard Treatment Guidelines and Drug Formulary. To be meaningful, all three tools should work in concert and subject for periodic review and update. I. The concept of Essential Medicines Essential Medicines (EM) are those that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population and therefore should be available at all times in appropriate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms. Following the concept of EM, WHO published the first Essential Medicine List (EML) in 1977, which has been updated successively every 5 year in view of changing world scenario about the medical needs and availability of new and better drugs. The selection of these medicines is based on public health relevance, evidence of efficacy and safety and comparative cost-effectiveness. These priority medicines should be available at each functioning health care facility with assured quality and adequate information at a price the individual and the community can afford. The selection of essential medicines depends upon level of health care facility, adequate data on the efficacy, safety, suitability and comparative cost effectiveness of available treatments. In addition, stability of the product, need for special diagnostic or treatment facilities and pharmacokinetic properties are also considered. Most essential medicines are formulated as single compound. However, fixed dose combinations are selected only when it has proven pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic advantages over single compound administered separately. While comparing the cost of medicines among the alternative treatments, the cost of total treatment and not the unit cost is considered. Other factors taken into account include pattern of diseases, treatment facilities, training and experience of the available personnel, financial resources etc. Advantages of Essential Medicines The implementation of the concept of EM has several logistic and prescribing advantages. For example better management of medicines i.e. easier procurement, storage,", "7a821e91-9d99-4b6b-992a-30bdd4bba864": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 2 distribution, more manageable stock, better quality assurance, easier dispensing, less fragmentation of budget with improve drug availability. Moreover, prescribing improves due to focused training and drug information, better recognition of adverse drug reactions, drug interactions and focused education efforts. The list of EM closely relates to treatment guidelines for clinical diseases and is also used for the procurement and supply of medicines in public sector, schemes for reimburses medicines costs and local medicine production. Its implementation is intended to be flexible and adaptable to different situations; which medicines are regarded as essential remains a national responsibility. II. Standard Treatment Guidelines Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs), treatment protocols, and prescribing policies are defined as systematically developed statements designed to assist prescribers in making decisions about the appropriate treatment and health care for specific clinical problem. These guidelines usually reflect the consensus on the optimal treatment options within a health facility or system. In fact, they represent one of the approaches to promote therapeutically effective and economically efficient use of medicines. STGs list the preferred pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for common health problems experienced by people in a specific health system. The pharmacological treatment should include the name, dosage form, strength, average dose (pediatric and adult), number of doses per day, and duration of treatment. Other information on diagnosis and advice to the patient may also be included. The most common diseases and serious medical conditions that have high morbidity and mortality rate are selected. Treatment guidelines must have the most up-to-date and evidence based information to determine appropriate treatment options by expert authors and reviewers. Effective implementation, however, is perhaps the greatest challenge in introducing STGs. When implemented effectively, it offers several advantages to patients, health care providers, supply management personnel and policy makers as follows: Patients, \uf0b7 Most cost-effective optimal therapy is provided. \uf0b7 Better compliance through consistency among prescribers. \uf0b7 Improvement in availability of drugs. \uf0b7 Overall better quality of care. Health care providers, \uf0b7 Provides standardized guidance to practitioners \uf0b7 Quality of care standard- based on expert consensus and basis for monitoring \uf0b7 Utilizes only formulary or essential medicines, so the health care system needs to provide only the medicines in the STGs. Supply managers, \uf0b7 Identification of medicines to be available for the most commonly treated problems.", "26b124f3-0ea6-48de-a833-7db8bb22b91d": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 3 \uf0b7 Facilitation of prepackaging of course-of-therapy quantities of commonly prescribed items. \uf0b7 Medicine demand more predictable, so forecasting more reliable Health care policy makers, \uf0b7 Provides focus therapeutic integration of special programs (diarrhea disease control, acute respiratory infection) \uf0b7 Provides a system for controlling cost by using funds more efficiently STGs also have certain drawbacks. Establishing, developing and implementation of STGs is a difficult, lengthy and time consuming process. Moreover, it needs to be updated regularly to reflect changes in treatment strategies. If a regular schedule for updating the STGs is not followed, they lose credibility and become obsolete. The extent of information to be provided in each medical condition is often a difficult decision. However, the STG manual should be concise and small enough to carry it easily. Key features of a successful STG manual Simplicity- The number of health problem is limited to commonly observed conditions. Each clinical condition list a few salient features with clear and concise information on pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatment. Credibility- Guidelines developed by the most respected experienced clinicians in the country and revision is based on actual experience. Treatment standards for all levels of health care facility- Health care providers use the same standard treatment; however, the referral criterion differs. While the first choice treatment for a patient depends upon the patient\u2019s diagnosis and condition and not on the prescriber. Medicine supply based on standards- The supply of medicines must match with the standard treatment and list of essential medicines. Regular updating- Any change in the therapeutic options, bacterial resistance pattern should be incorporated in the revised version to reflect current recommendations. User friendly- The STGs should be published as small, durable pocket manual which make it convenient to carry and use. III.Drug Formulary A formulary is a compendium of practical drug information for clinical practice adapted for use at a particular health care facility. It is a ready reference to key information on the selection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines. Although the concept of formulary is old, a drug formulary is considered an essential element in achieving rational prescribing in addition to controlling the costs. The task of development of a formulary in a hospital is usually undertaken by Drugs and Therapeutics Committee with a multidisciplinary membership of doctors, pharmacists, nurses and administrative staff.", "e319b522-85dc-481b-be59-b448e9e39e2b": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 4 The consultants place a request for inclusion of medicines along with its dosage formulations to Drugs and Therapeutics Committee. The committee may accept the request and include it in formulary or reject and suggest an alternative with information to the prescriber. The committee then monitors the impact, cost and benefits of various medicines in the health care facility. Depending on the outcome, the use of medicine is extended or curtailed. Formularies have significant advantages for patients care. However, the introduction of formularies may cause friction since it may be viewed as a major threat to their clinical freedom. Effective multidisciplinary working methods and consultation is needed to overcome this attitude. Potential advantages and disadvantages of drug formularies are as follows: Advantages \uf0b7 Reduces range of products to be purchased / stored / distributed \uf0b7 Encourages generic prescribing \uf0b7 Lowers drug costs \uf0b7 Improved knowledge of a limited number of medicines \uf0b7 Improves drug safety \uf0b7 Improves patient care \uf0b7 Provides opportunity for multidisciplinary work Disadvantages \uf0b7 Restricts prescribing choice \uf0b7 Reduces treatment options \uf0b7 Inhibits introduction of new products \uf0b7 Restricts research efforts IV.Rational Approach To Therapeutics Medicines should only be prescribed when necessary, and the benefit of administering the medicine should be considered in relation to the risks involved. Bad prescribing habits lead to ineffective and unsafe treatment, exacerbation or prolongation of illness, distress and harm to the patient, and higher cost. The Guide to Good Prescribing; WHO; 1994, provides medical undergraduates with important tools for training in the process of rational prescribing. The following steps will help to remind prescribers of the rational approach to therapeutics. 1. Define the patient\u2019s problem Whenever possible, making the right diagnosis is based on integrating many pieces of information: the complaint as described by the patient; a detailed history; physical examination; laboratory tests; X-rays and other investigations. This will help in rational prescribing, always bearing in mind that disease are evolutionary process.", "491e3fa7-2020-46dd-b314-407dd800a67f": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 5 2. Specify the therapeutic objective Doctors must clearly state their therapeutic objectives based on the pathophysiology underlying the clinical situation. Very often physicians must select more than one therapeutic goal for each patient. 3. Selecting therapeutic strategies The selected strategy should be discussed with the patient. The selected treatment can be non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological; it also needs to take into account the total cost of all therapeutic options. a. Non-pharmacological treatment The patient does not always need a medicine for treatment of the condition. Very often, health problems can be resolved by a change in life style, dietary habits, use of physiotherapy or exercise, provision of adequate psychological support and other non- pharmacological treatments; they have the same importance as a prescription drug and instructions must be written, explained and monitored in the same way. b. Pharmacological treatment Selecting the correct group of drugs Knowledge about the pathophysiology involved in the clinical situation of each patient and the pharmacodynamics of the chosen group of drugs, are two of the fundamental principles for rational therapeutics. Selecting the drug from the chosen group The selection process must consider benefit/risk/cost information. This step is based on evidence about maximal clinical benefits of the drug for a given indication (efficacy) with minimum production of adverse effects (safety). It must be remembered that each drug has adverse effects and it is estimated that up to 10% of hospital admissions in industrialized countries are due to adverse effects. Not all drug-induced injury can be prevented but much of it is caused by inappropriate selection of drugs. In cost comparisons between drugs, the cost of total treatment and not only the unit cost of the drug must be considered. Verifying the suitability of the chosen pharmaceutical treatment of each patient The prescriber must check suitability of the chosen active substance, its dosage form, dosage schedule and duration of treatment are suitable for each patient. Drug treatment should be individualized to the needs of each patient. Prescription writing The prescription is the link between the prescriber, the pharmacist (or dispenser) and the patient so it is important for successful management of presenting medical condition. The item is covered in more detail in the following section. Giving information, instructions and warnings This step is important to ensure patient adherence and is covered in detail in the following section.", "331766d7-7797-4740-97d2-daa9407e82dc": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 6 Monitoring treatment Evaluation of the follow up and the outcome of treatment provides information whether the patient\u2019s problem is solved or to reformulate, if necessary. This step gives rise to important information about the effects and adverse effects of medicines, contributing to the evidence of knowledge, necessary to promote the rational use of drugs. V. Adverse Drug Effects and Drug Interactions Adverse drug reactions An adverse drug reaction (ADR) may be defined as \u2018A response to a drug which is noxious, unintended and occurs at doses normally used for prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease, or for the modification of physiological function\u2019. ADRs are therefore unwanted or unintended effects of a medicine, including idiosyncratic effects, which occur during its proper use. An adverse drug event (ADE) is defined as \u2018Any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a medicine but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment\u2019. Two types of ADRs and their differentiating characteristics have been identified. The common, predictable, dose related reaction with low mortality is type \u2018A\u2019 ADR. For example, anticholinergic effect of tricyclic antidepressants and digoxin toxicity. ADRs may also be unrelated to the known pharmacological action of a drug. These are uncommon, non-dose related bizarre \u2018B\u2019 type reactions, for example, anaphylaxis with penicillins, malignant hyperthermia with halothane. Thalidomide marked the first recognized public health disaster related to the introduction of a new drug. It is now recognized that clinical trials, however through, cannot be guaranteed to detect all adverse effects likely to be caused by a drug. Health workers are thus encouraged to record and report to their national pharmacovigilance centre any unexpected adverse effects with any drug to achieve faster recognition of serious related problems. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), Director General of Health Services under the influence of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, has initiated a nationwide Pharmacovigilance programme for protecting the health of the patients by assuring drug safety. The specific aims and objectives of the National Pharmacovigilance Programme are: \uf0b7 To monitor ADRs in Indian population. \uf0b7 To create awareness amongst health care professionals about the importance of ADR reporting in India \uf0b7 To ensure that the benefits of use of medicine outweighs the risks and thus safeguard the health of the Indian population \uf0b7 To generate independent, evidence based recommendations on the safety of medicines", "cc6cd5dd-1845-457a-b35d-cd943da09499": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 7 \uf0b7 To encourage safe, rational and cost effective use of medicines. Under the National Coordinating Center, several ADR monitoring centers operates to detect ADEs. These ADR monitoring centers are located at MCI approved medical colleges and hospitals, private hospitals, public health programmes, and autonomous institutions such as Indian Council of Medical Research etc. The ADR monitoring centers record and analyze the ADEs and submit them to the National Coordinating center via online reporting system known as Vigiflow. Spontaneous reporting Spontaneous reporting is the reporting of ADRs by healthcare professionals (and in some countries consumers) to identify and report any suspected adverse drug reaction to a pharmacovigilance center and/or to the manufacturer. It is one of the important methods of collecting information about ADRs. All suspected adverse reactions, known or unknown, serious or otherwise should be reported. It is important to report even minor reactions of new drugs. For established drugs, the reporting of serious ADRs is important. An increased frequency of a known ADR to a drug is also important. Adverse drug reactions may be reported or notified to the nearest ADR monitoring centre under the National Pharmacovigilance Program. The Department of Pharmacology, B. J. Medical College is one of the approved ADR monitoring center in Gujarat state. The ADRs can be reported by the forms available at the department. Reporting is the process of providing ADR information by filling in the ADR form appropriately giving details of the clinical case as well as the ADR ( Appendix \u2013 I). Major factors predisposing to adverse drug effects It is well known that different patients often respond differently to a given treatment regimen. For example, patients taking combinations of drugs known to interact, only a small number show any clinical evidence of interactions. In addition to the pharmaceutical properties of drug therefore, there are characteristics of the patient which predispose to ADRs. Extremes of age: The very old and the very young are more susceptible to ADRs. Drugs which commonly cause problems in the elderly include hypnotics, diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensives, psychotropics and digoxin. All children and particularly neonates, differ from adults in their response to drugs. Some drugs are likely to cause problems in neonates (for example morphine), but are generally tolerated in children. Other drugs (for example valproic acid) are associated with increased risk of ADRs in children of all ages. Other drugs associated with problems in children include chloramphenicol (Grey baby syndrome), antiarrhythmics (worsening of arrhythmias), acetylsalicylic acid (Reye syndrome). Intercurrent illness: If besides the condition being treated, the patient suffers from another disease, such as kidney, liver or heart disease, special precautions may be", "04e1b59d-87ad-4038-b5b3-ad502255907c": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 8 necessary to prevent ADRs. The genetic make-up of the individual patient may also predispose to ADRs. Drug interactions: May occur between drugs which compete for the same receptor or act on the same physiological system. They may also occur indirectly when a drug-induced disease or a change in fluid or electrolyte balance alters the response to another drug. Incompatibilities between drugs and intravenous fluids Drugs should not be added to blood, amino acid solutions or fat emulsions. Certain drugs, when added to intravenous fluids, may be inactivated by pH changes, by precipitation or chemical reaction. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin lose potency after 6-8 hours if added to dextrose solutions, due to the acidity of the solutions. Some drugs bind to plastic containers and tubing, for example diazepam and insulin. Aminoglycosides are incompatible with penicillins and heparin. Hydrocortisone is incompatible with heparin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Adverse effects caused by traditional medicines Patients who have been or are taking traditional herbal remedies may develop ADRs. It is not always easy to identify the responsible plant or plant constituent. Refer to the drug and toxicology information service if available or to suitable literature. The effect of food on drug absorption Food delays gastric emptying and reduces the rate of absorption of many drugs; the total amount of drug absorbed may or may not be reduced. However, some drugs are preferably taken with food, either to increase absorption or to decrease the irritant effect on the stomach. VI.Prescription writing A prescription is an instruction from a prescriber to a dispenser. Every country has its own standards for the minimum information required for a prescription, and its own laws and regulations to define which drugs require a prescription and who is entitled to write it. Many countries have separate regulations for prescriptions for controlled drugs such as opioid analgesics. The following guidelines will help to ensure that prescriptions are correctly interpreted and leave no doubt the intension of the prescriber. The guidelines are relevant for primary care prescribing; they may, however, be adapted for use in hospitals or other specialist units. Prescription form The most important requirement is that the prescription be clear and legible and indicate precisely what should be given. The local language may be preferred. The following details should be shown on the form: \uf0b7 The prescriber\u2019s name, address and telephone number. This will allow either the patient or the dispenser to contact the prescriber for any clarification or potential problem with the prescription.", "380682fd-c189-477e-b71a-b2d687643894": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 9 \uf0b7 Date of the prescription. In many countries the validity of a prescription has no time limit, but in some countries pharmacists do not dispense drugs on prescriptions older than 3 to 6 months. \uf0b7 Name, form and strength of the drug. The International Non-proprietary Name of the drug should always be used. If there is a specific reason to prescribe a special brand, the trade name can be added. Generic substitution is allowed in some countries. The pharmaceutical form (for example \u2018tablet\u2019, \u2018oral solution\u2019, \u2018eye ointment\u2019) should also be stated. \uf0b7 The strength of the drug should be stated in standard units using abbreviations that are consistent with the System International (SI). \u2018Microgram\u2019 and \u2018nanogram\u2019 should not, however, be abbreviated. Also, \u2018units\u2019 should not be abbreviated. Avoid decimals whenever possible. If unavoidable, a zero should be written in front of the decimal point. \uf0b7 Specific areas for filling in details about the patient including name, address and age. Directions Directions specifying the route, dose and frequency should be clear and explicit; use of phrases such as \u2018take as directed\u2019 or \u2018take as before\u2019 should be avoided. For preparations which are to be taken on an \u2018as required\u2019 basis, the minimum dose interval should be stated together with, where relevant, the maximum daily dose. It is good practice to qualify such prescriptions with the purpose of the medication (for example \u2018every 6 hours as required for pain\u2019, \u2018at night as required to sleep\u2019). It is good practice to explain the directions to the patient; these directions will then be reinforced by the label on the medicinal product and possibly by appropriate counseling by the dispenser. It may be worthwhile giving a written note for complicated regimens although it must be borne in mind that the patient may lose the separate note. Quantity to be dispensed The quantity of the medicinal product to be supplied should be stated such that it is not confused with either the strength of the product or the dosage directions. Alternatively, the length of the treatment course may be stated (for example \u2018for 5 days\u2019). Wherever possible, the quantity should be adjusted to match the pack sizes available. For liquid preparations the quantity should be stated in milliliters (abbreviated as \u2018ml\u2019) or litres (preferably not abbreviated since the letter \u2018l\u2019 could be confused with the figure \u20181\u2019). Narcotics and controlled substances The prescribing of a medicinal product that is liable to abuse requires special attention and may be subject to specific statutory requirements. Practitioners may need to be authorized to prescribe controlled substances; in such cases it might be necessary to indicate details of authority on the prescription. In particular, the strength, directions and the quantity of the controlled substance to be dispensed should be stated clearly, with all quantities written in words as well as in", "85701025-4a43-4367-927c-1d6100c742fe": "Introduction to Rational Use of Medicines 10 figures to prevent alteration.

The common causes of anaemia in India includes,reduced production due to deficiency of iron, folic acid, rarely vitamin B12, or an ineffective erythropoiesis secondary to many causes (anaemia of chronic disease, secondary to infections and inflammation, endocrinal disorders, primary bone marrow disorders like infiltration or hypoplasia), blood loss (which also leads to iron deficiency) and increased destruction of RBCs (haemolysis due to many causes of which thalassaemia is the commonest).", "d1c7c9b0-2d9d-4f23-a11a-0e0e7bec9862": "Common Conditions 15 Salient features Pharmacological treatment Iron deficiency anaemia \uf0b7 Treat the underlying cause: menorrhagia in women, gastrointestinal blood loss in all age groups including hookworm infestation, dietary deficiency, rarely malabsorption. \uf0b7 Tab. ferrous sulfate 200 mg 3 times a day. \uf0b7 Reduce the dose as haemoglobin rises to over 10 g/dl. Once haemoglobin is normal, continue with 1 tablet daily for at least three months. \uf0b7 Other preparations of iron are not superior, but they can be tried if patient does not find ferrous sulfate suitable. These include ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate. The rate of rise of haemoglobin should be 1 g/dl per week. \uf0b7 If this does not occur, consider ongoing blood loss, noncompliance, and associated haemoglobinopathy like thalassaemia carrier status, malabsorption, or an incorrect diagnosis. \uf0b7 Parenteral iron does not lead to a faster rise in haemoglobin. It is indicated in the following situations: (i) malabsorption of iron, (ii) intolerance of oral iron, (iii) in late pregnancy to ensure that foetal stores of iron are replenished rapidly, (iv) if ongoing blood loss exceeds the capacity to absorb oral iron (like in inoperable malignancy) and (v) in noncompliant patient.

The conventional and easy method of evaluating disturbances in fluid and electrolyte balance is the frequent measurement of the concentration of serum electrolytes. It is crucial to remember that intracellular and extracellular electrolytes are normally constant, and that major shifts in and out of 'compartments' can occur in disease with minimal changes in serum electrolyte. Compositional changes also involve disturbances in acid-base balance. I. Volume deficit \uf0b7Obvious causes Vomiting, diarrhoea, intestinal fistulae, nasogastric suction, fluid loss following burns, sequestration of fluid in soft tissue injuries and infections, diuretics, renal disease/adrenal insufficiency \uf0b7Less obvious causes Inadequate fluid intake, fluid loss through excessive sweating as in high fever, hot humid temperature, haemodialysis, haemofiltration from surgical incisions and tetanus Treatment The first principle is to restore circulating volume through infusion of intravenous fluids. Once this is satisfactorily achieved, disturbances in electrolytes and acid-base balance if present need to be rectified. Various fluids used for volume replacement are given below: Replacement fluids \uf0b7 Replacement fluids are used to replace abnormal loss of blood, plasma or other extracellular fluids as first line treatment for hypovolemia in: - Patients with established hypovolemia e.g. haemorrhagic shock. - Maintenance of normovolaemia in patients with ongoing fluid losses e.g. surgical blood loss. \uf0b7 Intravenous replacement fluids are the first line of treatment for hypovolemia. \uf0b7 Crystalloid maintenance fluids, which contain dextrose, are not suitable for use as replacement fluids. However, crystalloid solutions with a similar concentration of sodium to plasma (normal saline or balanced salt) solutions (Ringer's lactate or Hartmann's solutions) are effective as replacement fluids. These should be available in all hospitals where intravenous replacement fluids are used. Crystalloids should be infused in a volume at least three times the volume lost in order to correct hypovolemia. \uf0b7 All colloid solutions (albumins, dextran, gelatins and hydroxyethyl starch solutions) are replacement fluids. However, they have not been shown to be superior to crystalloids in resuscitation. Colloid solutions should be infused in a volume equal to the blood volume deficit. \uf0b7 Plasma should never be used as a replacement fluid. \uf0b7 Plain water should never be infused intravenously as it can cause haemolysis.", "5c2f2c5d-9837-4171-b455-82bd550a0eee": "Emergency Conditions 60 \uf0b7 In addition to the intravenous route, the intraosseous, oral, rectal or subcutaneous routes can be used for the administration of fluids, blood and certain drugs. However, with the exception of intraosseous route, other routes are generally unsuitable in severely hypovolemic patients. \uf0b7 Rectal fluids are administered through a plastic or rubber enema tube which is inserted into the rectum and connected to a bag or bottle of fluid. A safe and effective solution for a rectal rehydration is 1 liter of clean drinking water with teaspoon of table salt. \uf0b7 Subcutaneous fluids can be used when other route of administration of fluids are unavailable. A cannula or needle is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue (the abdominal wall is a preferred site) and sterile fluids are administered in a conventional manner. Do not give dextrose-containing solutions subcutaneously as they can cause sloughing of tissues. \uf0b7 Oral and nasogastric fluids: Oral rehydration can often be used in mildly hypovolemic patients if the oral route is not contraindicated. Do not use if: - The patient is unconscious. - The patient has gastrointestinal lesions or reduced gut motility e.g. obstruction. - General anaesthesia and surgery is planned imminently. WHO/UNICEF formula for oral rehydration fluid: Dissolve in one litre of drinkable water Sodium chloride 2.6 g/L Trisodium citrate, dihydrate 2.9 g/L Potassium chloride 1.5 g/L Glucose anhydrous 13.5 g/L Resulting concentrations Na 75 mmol/L, CI 65 mmol/L, K 20 mmol/L, Glucose anhydrous 75 mmol/ L, Citrate 10 mmol/L, total osmolarity 245 mmol/L. Maintenance fluids Maintenance fluids are used to replace the normal physiological loss that occurs through skin, lung, faeces and urine. Since a considerable proportion of the loss is water, maintenance fluids are mainly composed of water in the form of a dextrose solution. Some electrolytes may also be included in these solutions. Before giving any intravenous infusion: \uf0b7 Check that the seal of the infusion fluid bottle or bag is not broken. \uf0b7 Check the expiry date. \uf0b7 Check that the solution is clear and free from visible particles. II. Volume excess Volume excess is often iatrogenic when the fluid intake has consistently exceeded the output. Excessive intravenous infusions of saline and blood transfusions are important", "9316c4ab-8853-48bb-b473-a7fb6f9ab304": "Emergency Conditions 61 causes of hypervolemia. Renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, liver disease and other causes of sodium retention, or excessive sodium administration can all produce increase in extracellular fluid content and hypervolemia. Salient features Treatment In moderate volume excess, salt restriction, restriction of fluid intake and the use of frusemide as a diuretic will solve the problem. Fulminant pulmonary oedema secondary to over hydration from over transfusion of blood or fluids is more appropriately dealt with by phlebotomy in stages so that pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is reduced below 15 mm Hg.

Hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can also produce skin changes, including acrocyanosis and necrosis of peripheral tissues. \uf0b7 Hematologic changes include neutropenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and DIC. Thrombocytopenia occurs in over 30 percent of patients with sepsis. DIC is more often associated with gram-negative sepsis. Decompensated DIC presents with clinical bleeding and thrombosis. Laboratory studies can show thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial prothromboplastin time (PTT), decreased fibrinogen level and antithrombin levels, and increased fibrin monomer, fibrin split values, and D- dimer values. \uf0b7 Hyperglycemia may be the result of increased catecholamines, cortisol, and glucagon. Increased insulin resistance, decreased insulin production, and impaired utilization of insulin may further contribute to hyperglycemia. \uf0b7 Arterial blood gas (ABG) studies in early sepsis may reveal hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis.

Snakes in India There are about 236 species of snakes in India, most of which are non-poisonous, however, there are 13 known species that are poisonous and four of these, namely Indian cobra, Russell's viper, saw- scaled viper and Indian krait are highly venomous and are believed to be responsible for most of the poisonous bites in India Salient features Investigations \uf0b7 Identification of snake, local swelling within few minutes after bite is an important sig of viper envenomization. \uf0b7 Blood stained sputum and non clotting of blood are diagnostic criteria for Russel viper and Saw scaled viper poisoning. \uf0b7 Ptosis and glossopharyngeal palsy are diagnostic criteria for Cobra and Indian Krait poisoning. \uf0b7 Investigations include - 20 minute whole blood clotting test - Hb/ platelet count/ peripheral smear/ PT/ APTT/ FDP/ D-Dimer - Urine examination for proteinuria/RBC/ hemoglobinuria/ myoglobinuria - Serum creatinine/ urea/ potassium - Oxygen saturation/ PR/BP/ RR/ postural blood pressure - ECG/ X-Ray/ CT/ ultrasound (the use of X-Ray and ultrasound are of unproven benefit, apart from identification of bleeding in viperine bites). - ELISA to confirm snake species Treatment First aid measures (RIGHT approach) R: reassure patient and control anxiety I: immobilize bitten part by splinting the limb \uf0b7 Viper envenomization (haemovasculotoxic): swelling and local pain, tender enlargement of local lymph nodes, bleeding from any orifice,epistaxis, vomiting, hypotension, petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses \uf0b7 Elapid envenomization (neurotoxic): swelling and local pain, local necrosis and blistering, descending paralysis, ptosis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, paralysis of jaw and tongue, numbness around the lip and mouth, inadequate ventilation, paradoxical respiration.", "efa383a0-918e-41c0-ac31-52e8b4cbadc4": "Emergency Conditions 78 G-H: get to hospital- transfer the victim to the nearest treatment facility T: tell the doctor about any symptoms Do Not: Apply tourniquet, wash the bite site with soap and any other solution, make cuts or incision on or near bitten area, apply extreme cold or herbal and folk remedies, suck venom, give the victim drink, alcohol or drugs \uf0b7 Ensure airway, breathing and shock management \uf0b7 Pain can be relieved with non sedating analgesic- oral paracetamol \uf0b7 Anti-snake venom (ASV) is the mainstay of treatment. In India polyvalent ASV is available which is effective against all the four common species. ASV should be administered only when there are definite signs of envenomation i.e. coagulopathy or neurotoxicity \uf0b7 Mild and severe envenomation requires 8 to 10 vials.

INSECT AND ARACHNID BITES Insect arachnid (spider, scorpion) bites and stings are common and usually cause minor irritation. However, some stings can be painful and trigger a serious allergic reaction. Salient features \uf0b7 Skin around the bite becomes red, swollen and itchy. The venom from a sting often causes a swollen, itchy, red mark (a weal) to form on the skin. This can be painful and itchy for a few days, but is harmless in most cases.

Patients appear flushed and the skin is hot and dry. Pharynx is normal despite a severe sore throat. \uf0b7 There may be mild cervical lymphadenopathy. Illness generally resolves over 2-5 days and recovery occurs in 1 week. Cough may persist 1-3 weeks longer and post influenza asthenia may persist for several weeks. \uf0b7 Frank dyspnoea, hyperpnoea, cyanosis, diffuse rales and signs of consolidation are indicative of pulmonary complications. Symptoms of severe disease may include apnea, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, cyanosis, dehydration, altered mental status and extreme irritability. Case Definitions \uf0b7 A confirmed case of H1N1 infection is defined as a person with an acute febrile respiratory illness with laboratory confirmed H1N1 infection at CDC by one or more of the following tests: realtime RT-PCR, viral culture or four fold increase in H1N1 virus specific neutralizing antibodies. \uf0b7 A probable case of H1N1 is a defined as a person with acute respiratory illness who is positive for influenza A but negative to H2 and HB by RT-PCR. \uf0b7 A suspected case of H1N1 is defined a person with an acute febrile respiratory illness who has had dose contact with a person who is a swine-origin influenza confirmed case or travelled to a community one or more confirmed swine origin influenza cases or resides in a community where there are one or more confirmed swine origin influenza A (H1N1) cases. Salient features Investigations Upper respiratory specimens, nasopharyngeal swab or wash, nasal, aspirate or tracheal aspirate should be tested by the state public health laboratory.

For sore throat, short course of topical decongestants, saline nasal drops, throat lozenges and steam inhalation may be beneficial. \uf0b7 Salicylate / aspirin is strictly contra-indicated in any influenza patient due to its potential to cause Reye\u2019s syndrome. \uf0b7 The suspected cases would be constantly monitored for clinical / radiological evidence of lower respiratory tract infection and for hypoxia (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, level of consciousness). \uf0b7 Patients with signs of tachypnea, dyspnea, respiratory distress and oxygen saturation less than 90 per cent should be supplemented with oxygen therapy. Types of oxygen devices depend on the severity of hypoxic conditions which can be started from oxygen cannula, simple mask, partial re-breathing mask (mask with reservoir bag) and non re-breathing mask. In children, oxygen hood or head boxes can be used. \uf0b7 Patients with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory failure (SpO2 < 90% and PaO2 <60 mmHg with oxygen therapy) must be supported with mechanical ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation is preferred choice. Non invasive ventilation is an option when mechanical ventilation is not available. To reduce spread of infectious aerosols, use of HEPA filters on expiratory ports of the ventilator circuit / high flow oxygen masks is recommended. \uf0b7 Maintain hydration, electrolyte balance and nutrition. \uf0b7 If the laboratory reports are negative, the patient would be discharged after giving full course of oseltamivir.

Pharmacological treatment \uf0b7 Evacuation of the pus by pulling the involved lash or incising the abscess. \uf0b7 Antibiotic eye drops and ointment- to control and prevent spread of infection (fluoroquinolones e.g. moxifloxacin 0.5% eye drops 4 to 6 hourly until infection subsides) \uf0b7 Systemic antibiotics (e.g. Tab. amoxicillin with clavulanic acid 625 mg TDS for 5 days) \uf0b7 For pain and inflammation e.g. Tab. ibuprofen 400 mg TDS till inflammation subsides. Patient education \uf0b7 Maintain ocular hygiene to prevent recurrence. CHALAZION A chalazion (meibomian cyst) is a chronic, sterile, granulomatous inflammatory lesion caused by retained sebaceous secretion leaking from the meibomian or other sebaceous glands into adjacent stroma. A chalazion secondarily infected is referred as an internal hordeolum.

It often starts in one eye and involves the fellow eye a few days later. \uf0b7 On examination, inferior palpebral conjunctival follicles and pinpoint subconjunctival haemorrhages are observed. The common organism responsible is Adenovirus. \uf0b7 Conjunctival cultures/swabs are not needed unless the discharge is excessive or the condition becomes chronic. Non- pharmacological treatment \uf0b7 Treatment may not be required because at least a third of chalazia resolve spontaneously and an internal hordeolum may discharge and disappear. Persistent lesions may be treated as follows: \uf0b7 Dry hot fomentation applied frequently in early stage is useful. Pharmacological treatment \uf0b7Steroid injection into the lesion is preferable if close to the lacrimal punctum because of the risk of surgical damage. - Between 0.2 and 2 ml of 5 mg/mL triamcinolone diacetate aqueous suspension diluted with lidocaine (or equivalent) to a concentration of 5 mg/mL is injected through the conjunctiva into the tissue around the lesion with a 30-gauge needle. - The success rate following one injection is about 80%. In unresponsive cases a second injection can be given 2 weeks later. \uf0b7 Cap. doxycycline (100 mg BD for 7 days) may be required as prophylaxis in patients with recurrent chalazia, particularly if associated with acne rosacea. \uf0b7 Incision and curettage, in case of large chalazia, if present for more than 3 \u2013 4 months or if cosmetically unacceptable.

A slight degree of meconium without fetal heart rate abnormalities is a warning of the need for vigilance. Thick meconium suggests passage of meconium in reduced amniotic fluid and may indicate the need for expedited delivery and management of the neonatal upper airway at birth to prevent meconium aspiration.

INDUCTION AND AUGMENTATION OF LABOUR Induction of labour refers to stimulating the uterus to begin labour. While augmentation of labour means stimulating the uterus during labour to increase the frequency, duration and strength of contractions.", "d2d6911f-ce4c-4563-a860-e39729b0f0ee": "Obstetrics and Gynecology 260 A good labour pattern is established when there are three contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting more than 40 seconds. If the membranes are intact, it is recommended practice in both induction and augmentation of labour to first perform artificial rupture of membranes (ARM). In some cases, this is all that is needed to induce labour. Membrane rupture, whether spontaneous or artificial, often sets off the following chain of events: - Amniotic fluid is expelled; - Uterine volume is decreased; - Prostaglandins are produced, stimulating labour; - Uterine contractions begin (if the woman is not in labour) or become stronger (if she is already in labour). Artificial rupture of membranes \uf0b7 Note: In areas where HIV and/or hepatitis are highly prevalent, it is prudent to leave the membranes intact for as long as possible to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV \uf0b7 Monitor the fetal heart rate. \uf0b7 Ask the woman to lie on her back with her legs bent, feet together and knees apart. \uf0b7 Wearing sterile gloves, use one hand to examine the cervix and note the consistency, position, effacement and dilatation. \uf0b7 Use the other hand to insert an amniotic hook or a Kocher clamp into the vagina. \uf0b7 Guide the clamp or hook towards the membranes along the fingers in the vagina. \uf0b7 Place two fingers against the membranes and gently rupture the membranes with the instrument in the other hand. Allow the amniotic fluid to drain slowly around the fingers. \uf0b7 Note the colour of the fluid (clear, greenish, bloody).

Assessment of the cervix \uf0b7 The success of induction of labour is related to the condition of the cervix at the start of induction. To assess the condition of the cervix, a cervical exam is performed and a score is assigned based on the criteria (Table 5): \uf0b7 If the cervix is favourable (has a score of 6 or more), labour is usually successfully induced with oxytocin alone. \uf0b7 If the cervix is unfavourable (has a score of 5 or less), ripen the cervix using prostaglandins or a Foley catheter before induction.", "a9cd8d75-aa4d-4b68-88f3-97c133e75d8c": "Obstetrics and Gynecology 261 Table 5.

Multiparous women are at higher risk for uterine rupture. \uf0b7 The effective dose of oxytocin varies greatly between women. Cautiously administer oxytocin in IV fluids (dextrose or normal saline), gradually increasing the rate of infusion until good labour is established (three contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting more than 40 seconds). Maintain this rate until delivery. The uterus should relax between contractions. \uf0b7 Monitor the woman\u2019s pulse, blood pressure and contractions, and check the fetal heart rate. \uf0b7 When oxytocin infusion results in a good labour pattern, maintain the same rate until delivery. \uf0b7 Carefully observe women receiving oxytocin. \uf0b7 Record the following on a partograph every 30 minutes rate of infusion of oxytocin. \uf0b7 Look for fetal heart rate.

The awareness, regarding the nature of mental illnesses and the need for treatment, and their acceptance is also improving. Although psychopharmacology forms the backbone of treatment in most psychiatric disorders, certain points need to be especially emphasized while managing psychiatric patients: 1) The formation of a trusting, confidential, non-judgemental and empathetic doctor - patient relationship is crucial to the practice of psychiatry. 2) Knowing the person as a whole rather than only his symptoms endorses patient improvement. 3) The psychotic patient often loses his judgement and reality perception. Such patients often have to be treated against their will. 4) Family has an important role in the causation and management of psychiatric disorders. 5) All patients do well with holistic treatment which includes psychopharmacology, other biological treatments, psychotherapy and rehabilitation. 6) Psychiatric treatment often continues for a long period, so compliance is a major issue.

Shaving results in damage to skin and leads to abrasions that may not be visible and may lead to post operative wound infection. \uf0b7 One should ask for history of allergic reactions to any chemical solutions. \uf0b7 While scrubbing, one should work away from the operative site. Visibly soiled skin should be washed with soap and water before using surgical scrub. Preanaesthetic medication as per policy. \uf0b7 Skin preparation for surgery: Preoperative surgical antisepsis aims at blocking infection in to surgical wound and consists of hand washing, gloving along with application of antiseptic to surgical site. Different surgical scrubs available for skin preparation before surgical procedure include any of the following: Povidone-iodine: It acts by oxidation/substitution of free iodine. Povidone iodine is used as a surgical scrub after combining with detergent. It is effective against gram positive bacteria but weaker against other microorganisms. It has a residual activity and is active in presence of organic substance. It is absorbed through skin. It can be used on mucus membranes. Patient skin sensitivity is occasionally a problem. Chlorhexidine gluconate It is a broad spectrum antiseptic that is better than povidone-iodine as a bactericidal. This has a residual activity that continues to kill microorganisms after application. It is not effective in presence of organic material like soap sand oils, blood and body fluids. It should be avoided in preparation of eye. It may be used alone or in combination with cetrimide. Alcohol (70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol): It is 95% effective against gram negative and gram positive bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi and viruses. It is not completely effective against spores. All traces of alcohol should be dry before drapes are put. Alcohol is never used on mucus membranes and open wounds as it may causes desiccation. \uf0b7 Drug treatment: e.g. prophylactic antibiotics (see section on antibiotic prophylaxis), antihypertensives, IV fluids, anticoagulants, Vitamin K etc. where relevant. \uf0b7 Non drug treatment e.g., rectal washouts, stomach wash, etc. where relevant. \uf0b7 Handling of medicolegal cases: First aid has to be provided in all cases who report in an emergency state.

POSTOPERATIVE PAIN RELIEF \uf0b7 Postoperative pain is associated with all surgical procedures. This varies according to the surgical procedure. Severe pain can prolong gastrointestinal ileus, urinary retention, impair respiratory movements producing atelectasis and predisposes to deep vein thrombosis due to immobilization. \uf0b7 Various methods to alleviate postoperative pain are NSAIDs, opioids (intra muscular, transdermal or transmucosal), patient controlled analgesia, local infiltration of anaesthetic drugs, epidural analgesia and intrapleural analgesia. The method used depends upon the site and the magnitude of surgery done, severity of pain, whether the patient is allowed orally, facilities and expertise available. It is necessary to give analgesics by intramuscular or intravenous route in the immediate postoperative period and till the patient is able to accept orally. Commonly used agents are \uf0b7 Inj. diclofenac sodium 75 mg 6-8 hourly Or \uf0b7 Inj. tramadol (50 mg/ml) IM/IV 4-6 hourly, \uf0b7 Inj. pentazocine (30mg/ml) 30-60mg IM/IV repeated 3-4hourly. \uf0b7 Inj. morphine (15 mg/ml)10-15mg,can be repeated 4-6 times. \uf0b7 In tertiary care centers, epidural analgesia, intravenous patient controlled analgesia, intrapleural analgesia can be used under expert care.", "4c5b8912-639e-41d3-82d7-0681a743e2f5": "Surgery 320 When patient is able to accept orally, \uf0b7 Tab.paracetamol 500mg3-4 times a day.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery The goals of prophylactic administration of antibiotics to surgical patients are to: \uf0b7 Reduce the incidence of surgical site infection; \uf0b7 Fever, productive cough, dyspnoea, chest pain. \uf0b7 Bronchial breathing and presence of rales. \uf0b7 Chest X-ray shows area of consolidation", "3ac67d38-ebea-40ef-9c1a-93fbfbf835b2": "Surgery 321 \uf0b7 Use antibiotics in a manner that is supported by evidence of effectiveness; minimize the effect of antibiotics on the patient's normal bacterial flora; adverse effects. Prophylaxis is uniformly recommended for all clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty procedures. It is considered optional for most clean procedures, although it may be indicated for certain patients and clean procedures that fulfill specific risk criteria. It is important to emphasize that surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an adjunct to, not a substitute for good surgical technique. \uf0b7 Antibiotics prophylaxis should be regarded as one component of an effective policy for the control of hospital acquired infection in procedure that requires the insertion of implants or prosthetic devices, the term. Surgical site infection is used to encompass the surgical wound and the implant. Surgical site infection also encompasses infections involving the body cavity (e.g. subphrenic abscess), bones, joints, meninges and other tissues involved in the operation. Throughout this guideline the term surgical site infection (SSl) is used, unless the evidence relates specifically to surgical wound infection. SURGICAL SITE INFECTION Criteria for defining a surgical site infection (SSI) Superficial incisional SSI \uf0b7 Infection occurs within 30 day after the operation and infection involves only skin of subcutaneous tissue of the incision and at least one of the following \uf0b7 Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision \uf0b7 Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision. \uf0b7 At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: Pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness, heat and superficial incision is deliberately opened by a surgeon, unless, incision is culture-negative \uf0b7 Diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician Deep incisional SSI \uf0b7 Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within one year if implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involves deep soft tissues (e.g. fascial and muscle layers)of the incision and at least one of the following \uf0b7Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the surgical site. \uf0b7A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38\u00b0C) localized pain tenderness unless site is culture-negative \uf0b7An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination,during re-operation,or by histopathologyor radiologic examination.", "8f5b6d77-96e9-4e86-9682-96ddf8a62101": "Surgery 322 \uf0b7Diagnosis of deep incisional SSI by a surgeon or attending physician. Organ/space SSI \uf0b7 Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within one year if implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involves any part of the anatomy (e.g. organs or spaces), other than the incision, which was opened or manipulated during an operation and at least one of the following \uf0b7 Purulent discharge from a drain that is placed through a stab wound in to the organ/space. \uf0b7 Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the organ/space. \uf0b7 An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is found on direct examination, during re-operation, or by histopathologic or radiologic examination. \uf0b7 Diagnosis of an organ/space SSI by a surgeon or attending physician. Pharmacological treatment \uf0b7 The antibiotics selected for prophylaxis must cover the common pathogens. Antibiotics election is influenced by the organism most commonly causing wound. Infection in the specific procedure and by the relative costs of available agents. \uf0b7 Gastrointestinal procedures, oral and intravenous administration of agents with activity against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are warranted, as well as mechanical preparation of the bowel. Ceftriaxone/cefotaxime provides adequate coverage for most other types of procedures. The antibiotics chosen for prophylaxis can be those used for active treatment of infection. However, the chosen antibiotics must reflect local disease- specific information about the common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility. A past history of a serious adverse event should preclude administration of a particular antibiotic like penicillin. Timing and duration of prophylaxis \uf0b7 The first dose should always be given before the procedure, preferably within 30 minutes before incision. Re-administration at one to two half-lives of the antibiotic is recommended for the duration of the procedure. In general, postoperative administration is not recommended. \uf0b7 There may be situations where overriding factors alter the normal timing of administration. For example, during a caesarean section prophylaxis should be delayed until the cord is clamped in order to prevent the drug reaching the neonate. When a tourniquet is to be applied the necessary tissue concentration must be achieved prior to its application rather than the time of incision. This probably occurs within10 minutes of administration of an IV antibiotic injection. Antibiotics should also be administered immediately after unexpected contamination of the tissues additional doses during the operation. The individual surgeon should be free to give an extra dose for prolonged operations with major blood loss if they wish. However, there is insufficient evidence to make a general recommendation. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be confined to the peri operative period.", "a5ff20ff-8429-434d-b74f-edd279347049": "Surgery 323 Route of administration Intravenous administration of antibiotic prophylaxis immediately before or after induction of anesthesia is the most reliable method for ensuring effective serum antibiotic concentrations at the time of surgery. Dose selection A single dose of antibiotic at the therapeutic concentration is sufficient for prophylaxis under most circumstances. In adults, blood loss of up to1500 ml during surgery or haemodilution up to 15 ml/kg does not require an additional dose of prophylactic agent. In the event of major intraoperative blood loss (>1500ml) additional doses of prophylactic antibiotic should be given after fluid replacement. Antibiotic prophylaxis in all cardiac surgeries and interventions is recommended. Table 1.

Redness of the surrounding area and cellulites is often present. \uf0b7 Wound infections are generally evident between 3rd to 6th postoperative days Infection risk factors: Factors associated with increased risk of infection are: Systemic factors: Diabetes, corticosteroid use, obesity, extremes of age, malnutrition, recent surgery, massive transfusion, multiple (3 or more) preoperative co morbid medical diagnoses Local factors: foreign body, electrocautery; injection with epinephrine; wound drains; hair removal with razor; previous irradiation of site. Development of local guidelines It is advisable to make local surgical site infection prevention protocols be developed by local hospital management. Postoperative wound management \uf0b7 Most postoperative wounds are covered with occlusive dressings The occlusive dressing (semi permeable to water vapours and oxygen but impermeable to liquids) consists of a hydrating layer (antibiotic ointments or petroleum jelly), a non-adherent contact layer, an absorbent and cushioning layer(gauze), and a se- cu ring layer like hypo allergic tape. Occlusive dressings should be applied within 2 hours of wounding and left on for at least 24 hours for optimal healing to occur for acute wounds. These should never be used on infected wounds. Dressing changes can be performed once or twice daily. If other types of occlusive are used, the timing of the dressing changes will vary between I to 7 days, depending on the wound characteristics. POSTOPERATIVE WOUND INFECTION Wound infections are classified as \uf0b7 Minor e.g. stitch abscess, cellulitis. \uf0b7 Major e.g. presence of discrete collection of pus in wound. \uf0b7 Superficial infections are limited to skin and subcutaneous tissue. \uf0b7 Deep infections- involve the areas of wound below the fascia.

Deep infections \uf0b7 Antibiotics are given on the basis of pus culture and sensitivity in addition to drainage of wound. Prevention Postoperativewound infection rate can be minimized by adequate skin preparation, bowel preparation, prophylactic antibiotics, meticulous surgical technique WOUND CARE Wounds can be classified as acute or chronic and further as arterial, venous trophic, malignant. Acute wounds heal uneventfully within an expected time frame e.g. burns. For the purpose of guidelines, chronic wounds can be defined as an ulcer present at least for 6 weeks. Treatment Meticulous wound care includes adequate cleansing, debridement, oedema control and prevention of ischemia, Acute wounds \uf0b7The overall objective in caring for wounds that are incompletely clotted is to minimize unnecessary blood loss and to avoid the formation of a hematoma. \uf0b7Irrigate gently with copious quantities of water or normal saline. Debris and necrotic tissue should be removed without damaging healthy tissue. Sharp mechanical debridement may be necessary to expose viable tissue for large areas of fibrinous exudates or eschar. Chemical debridement is useful for those areas that are difficult to access by sharp debridement. Chemical debridement of the wounds may be done using topical antiseptics (chlorhexidine, povidoneiodine, alcohol, hydrogenperoxide, triclosan) and antibacterials (silver sulfadiazine, neomycin, polymyxin, bacitracin, mupirocin).When debridement is complete, dressings can be applied. \uf0b7Healing of acute wound is further facilitated by closure. Alternatively,closure can be delayed for several days to allow infection to clear. Wound healing is impaired by malnutrition, oedema, bacterial contamination, ischemia, smoking and immunosuppressant.

Surgical treatment \uf0b7 Surgical debridement in ulcer associated with necrotic tissue or slough. Clean the wound with physiological normal saline or tap water only (antiseptics delay wound healing). \uf0b7 Daily dressing: Gauze adhere to the wound bed and it may remove viable tissue from the wound surface on removal , resulting in delayed wound healing. Some of the commonly used dressings are: \uf0b7 Occlusive (moist ureretentive) dressings (Hydrocolloid gel) in case of clean and shallow ulcers without any pus discharge or other features of infection. Occlusive dressings have barrier properties that enable to prolong the presence of moisture and wound fluid in the wound bed. \uf0b7 Calcium alginate dressing: For bleeding wounds and wounds with a cavity. Patient education \uf0b7 To prevent ulcer in future, explain about the care of leg ulcers, wearing socks, shoes and compression stocking. \uf0b7 Good personal hygiene (daily bath) and after bath the healed scar area should be massaged with an emollient cream such as lanolin or some other oil to keep the scar tissue soft and supple and prevent further breakdown. \uf0b7 Regular use of calf muscle activating exercises and leg elevation and to avoid prolonged period of standing or sitting with legs down.

Pharmacological treatment (Table 5) \uf0b7 Bronchodilators- Used for symptomatic benefit in patients with COPD. The inhaled route is preferred for medication delivery as the incidence of side effects is lower than that seen with the use of parenteral medication delivery. \uf0b7 Theophylline produces modest improvements in expiratory flow rates and vital capacity and a slight improvement in arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Nausea is a common side effect; tachycardia and tremor have also been reported.

And second to apply shaking or vibrations at beginning of expiration. - Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP): It consists of a mouthpiece to which one way valve is connected which is attached with expiratory resister which provides pressure during expiration which helps in avoiding the collapsing airway and remove the secretions. - High Frequency Chest Compression (HFCC): It is used to give oscillations and compressions to whole lungs in sitting position helps in mucus clearance. - In diseases like Pleural Effusion the fluid gets accumulated in the pleural cavity so for that positioning in such a way that gravity assists the drainage of fluid faster through ICD occurs like side lying with sound side up and deep inspiration followed with maximum expiration eg. ballooning, bubble making etc.", "c0b183c3-34d1-41da-bcfc-1a2b0d3ef385": "365 Chapter 18 PEDIATRIC CONDITIONS NEWBORN CARE Salient features Treatment Establishment of breathing at birth \uf0b7 Most newborns cry immediately at birth and therefore need no assistance to establish breathing. If the baby is preterm, meconium stained or some evidence of infection, not crying or breathing or with poor muscle tone, then proceed to initial steps of resuscitation. \uf0b7 For term babies, use 100% oxygen when baby is cyanotic or when positive pressure ventilation is required. If room air is being used, supplementary oxygen should be available to use if there is no appreciable improvement within 90 seconds of birth. If supplemental oxygen is not available, positive pressure ventilation should be continued with room air. \uf0b7 Infants without signs of life (no heart beat and no respiratory effort) after 10 minutes of resuscitation show either a high mortality or severe neurodevelopmental disability. After 10 minutes of continuous and adequate resuscitative efforts, discontinuation of resuscitation may be justified if there are no signs of life. Hypothermia \uf0b7 Identification of hypothermia. An axillary (or rectal) temperature <36.0\u00b0C is hypothermia. Such a baby would feel cold to touch on the abdomen and periphery. \uf0b7 Identification of cold stress: Baby's peripheries are cold but abdomen is warm. This usually corresponds to axillary temperature of 36-36.4\u00b0C. \uf0b7 Prevention of hypothermia. - Dry the baby with warm dry linen at birth. Discard wet linen and wrap in dry linen.

If neither is available, place the newborn infant on the mother's chest \uf0b7 Essential newborn care (ENC) is a comprehensive strategy designed to improve the health of newborns through interventions before conception, during pregnancy, at and soon after birth, and in the postnatal period. \uf0b7 ENC comprises of: - Basic preventive newborn care such as care before and during pregnancy, clean delivery practices, eye and cord care, prevention of hypothermia and infection - Early and exclusive breastfeeding on demand day and night. - Early detection of problems or danger signs (with priority for sepsis and birth asphyxia) and appropriate referral and care seeking.", "566005a6-40df-4e9f-85c7-c5f336b0ce29": "Pediatric Conditions 366 and wrap baby and mother together to prevent heat loss from the exposed skin surfaces of the baby. - Ensure that there are no open windows or fans turning in the delivery area where baby is being delivered or being observed. - Suction mouth and then nose with mucous sucker - Delay bathing of newborn for the first few days; this will prevent hypothermia. However, baby may be wiped with warm clean water to remove dried blood, vernix or secretions. Care must be taken to ensure that the room is warm and draught free when the baby is being cleaned or bathed. The baby should immediately be wrapped in dry linen after being wiped dry. \uf0b7 After birth and for the first few days thereafter keep mother and baby in close proximity with baby being adequately clothed. In cold weather, the baby must have 2 layers of cotton vest with a woolen sweater, cap, socks and legs should be covered and baby should be wrapped in a blanket. In summer, cotton dress with a cotton diaper wrapped in a cotton cloth. Prevention of infection \uf0b7 Always clean hands with soap and water and wear sterile gloves if available before conducting the birth of the baby and while examining babies during the first few days of life. \uf0b7 A sterilized blade (if that is not available a new razor blade or a blade boiled for at least 20 minutes) must be used for cutting the cord at delivery. The cord tie used must be sterile or boiled for 20 minutes before used for tying the cord after birth. \uf0b7 The surface for conducting delivery and placing the baby after birth must be clean. \uf0b7 Do not apply anything to the cord or eyes after birth. \uf0b7 Do not give prelacteal feeds.

Some important clues to an underlying malformation are non-passage of meconium at 24 h of age or non-passage of urine at 48 h after birth. \uf0b7 Sucking, activity and cry. Newborn infants who have poor sucking, are less active than normal and have a weak cry are very ill and need immediate referral. \uf0b7 Respiratory distress. Babies who have a respiratory rate of >60 bpm (counted for at least 1 minute and persisting on repeat count) or have severe subcostal retractions have respiratory distress and need immediate referral. \uf0b7 Identification of severe jaundice. Yellow staining of the skin within 24 h of age or when yellow staining of the skin includes the palms and soles at any age, this is severe jaundice and needs immediate referral.

IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE \uf0b7 A number of vaccines available for childhood immunization to protect against are important national causes of childhood morbidity and mortality. \uf0b7 Both killed and live vaccines can be administered simultaneously without decreasing the efficacy of the individual vaccine. However, vaccines be administered at different sites using separate needles for each component. A gap of 1 month is recommended between 2 live vaccines if not given together. \uf0b7 Avoid giving injections if skin is infected or compromised by a skin lesion. Prepare skin with a disinfectant.

FLUID AND ELECTROLYTES THERAPY IN CHILDREN Fluid and electrolyte therapy is divided into three phases: Correction of pre-existing deficits like rehydration therapy for diarrhea. Provision of maintenance requirements for normal metabolism, correction of ongoing losses (diarrhea, vomiting) or removal (suction, aspiration). The maintenance requirements are as follows: A guideline for estimating daily fluid and electrolyte requirement in a normal child under normal conditions is: Weight Fluid requirement 3-10 kg 100 ml/kg/day 10-20 kg 1000 ml + 50 ml/kg/day for each kg above 10. > 20 kg 1500 ml + 20 ml/kg/day for each kg above 20. Maintenance fluid requirement replaces water loss through skin (2/3 of losses), GIT, respiration, and urine. These losses are affected by ambient humidity, clothing, body temperature, respiratory rate, and age of the child. Situation specific adjustments are necessary when calculating maintenance fluids. The most commonly employed intravenous maintenance fluid employed in children is N/5 (0.18%) sodium chloride in 5% glucose + potassium chloride 20 mEq/ Liter. Commercially it is available as Isolyte P, Kidral etc. Maintenance requirements in newborns The following table provides the normal fluid electrolyte requirements in newborn babies. Table 4.

However, in babies <1500 g the fluid requirement after day 7 need to be increased by 10-20 ml/kg/day till a maximum of 150 ml/kg/day. Conditions that increase fluid requirement \uf0b7 Fever: for every 1\u00b0C increases over 37.5\u00b0C, the fluid requirement increases by 10 ml/kg/day. \uf0b7 Phototherapy: this increases fluid requirement by 10-20 ml/kg/day. Conditions that decrease fluid requirement \uf0b7 Congestive cardiac failure: Fluid requirements are reduced to 2/3rd of the normal need for that age. \uf0b7 Renal failure: In cases of decreased urinary output, the fluid regimen is 400 ml/m2/day for insensible water losses plus urinary output over the day. Potassium should be added with caution or omitted in suspected cases of acute renal failure.

Asked to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool. \uf0b7 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give IV fluids. \uf0b7 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children with diarrhoea. \uf0b7 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) - Give in small sips. - Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent. - Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus. - Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops. \uf0b7 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes urine), as follows: - Some dehydration- 75 ml/kg. - Severe dehydration- 100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours) - Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg. \uf0b7 Specific therapy is indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF - Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy) - Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or - Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g) Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea) Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose.

At the onset of DM (or after recovery from DKA) the dose of insulin is 0.5-1.0 unit/kg/day. Inj. Regular insulin 0.1-0.25 units/kg subcutaneous injections are given 6-8 hourly before meals. - Simultaneous blood glucose level monitoring is done. One to two days therapy is required to find out total daily insulin requirement. Once the patient stabilizes on 6 hourly insulin injections, the patient is switched over to \"2 daily injections\" schedule. - In \"2 daily injections\" schedule, the insulin is administered as follows: Combinations of intermediate acting (usually lente) insulin and fast acting (regular) insulin in the ratio of 2-3:1. Two third of total daily -dose is injected before breakfast and one third before dinner. Each injection has combination of both types of insulin e.g., total dose of insulin is 30 units -20 units (14 units lente and 6 units regular) are injected before breakfast and 10 units (6 units lente and 4 units regular) are injected before dinner. - Blood glucose levels are monitored before each meal and the dose of insulin adjusted accordingly.
